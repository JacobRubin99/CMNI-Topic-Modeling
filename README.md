# CMNI-Topic-Modeling

This work evaluates the performance of three topic modeling techniques: latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), BERTopic, and ChatGPT, to analyze survey items from the Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory (CMNI) measurement. By comparing three distinct models, this work evaluates how closely topic modeling can mimic results typically achieved through traditional factor analysis without the need for respondent data.
